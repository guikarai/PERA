### Client LPAR Scorecard regarding z/OS Data set encryption
  For each client LPAR we use to provide a scorecard. The main objective of this scorecard is to highlight several aspect that matters for every z/OS Data set encryption projects.
  * **Total number of elligible data sets:** Usefull to estimate how much rich of data sets an LPAR is versus the others. This help to priorize which LPARs concentrate the volume of data set to be protected by encryption.
  * **z/OS Treemap view:** Helpful to represent z/OS data set structures, groups of data set, to intuit ownership and what could the policy to encrypt data sets.
  * **Extended-Format view:** Helpful to represent if an intermediate step is required before encrypted data at speed and volume. This step is dimensionning and can slow down your project and must be detected as soon as possible.
  * **Encrypted view:** Viewing how much your ellligible data is encrypted.
  * **Compressed view:** Viewing how much your ellligible data for encryption are compressed.
