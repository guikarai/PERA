# What is PERA?
Pervasive Encryption Readiness Assessment (or simply PERA) is an offering proposed by the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. 
There are 3 main questions our client ask about Pervasive Encryption. PERA as a technical study has been designed to help them having answer about the following questions:
* **READINESS** - Am I ready to start a Pervasive Encryption project? ***(Hardware, Software, Skills, Processes...)***
* **VOLUMES** - Does my today volume of data justify to jump-in Pervasive Encryption project? ***(Volume of elligible data sets, data mapping, volume of elligible network connections, network mapping)***
* **PERFORMANCE** - What could be the overhead? ***(Performance, Consumption, Project elapse...)***

# PERA advantages
The PERA study requires a very small client investment in time and effort. Client send data, and the IBM team works from these data.

The team in charge of PERA has more than 1 year of customer experience spent in Pervasive Encryption projects.More over, Montpellier client center team having more than 10 years of zMAX study and PERA has the similar approach and efficiency (Data collection first, Site client delivery second).

PERA is based on technical study. From our client data we can see everything that matters to evaluate client readiness for Pervasive Encryption. These data reveal the following:
* Hardware/Software readiness
* Available whitespace for Pervasive Encryption projects
* Encryption maturity
* How optimized is the crypto environment
* Data set structures, volumes and degree of ellibility
* Network architecture, volumes of unsecured network connections
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS data set encryption on selected LPARs
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS coupling facility encryption on selected LPARs

PERA includes two main livrables:
  * 1day on client site summary presentation
  * 200+ pages report
