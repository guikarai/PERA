# Pervasive Encryption Readiness & Deployment Assessment
A technical assessment from the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. 

## What is PERDA? 
The vision of Pervasive Encryption is to provide a simple, transparent, and consumable approach to enable extensive encryption of data in-flight and at-rest to substantially reduce the costs associated with protecting data and achieving compliance mandates.

Pervasive Encryption Readiness & Deployment Assessment (or simply PERDA) is an offering proposed by the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. 
There are 3 main questions our client ask about Pervasive Encryption. PERDA as a technical study has been designed to help them having answers about these questions:

:question: **READINESS** - Am I ready to start a Pervasive Encryption project? *(Hardware, Software, Skills, Processes...)*

:question: **VOLUMES** - Does my today volume of data justify to jump-in Pervasive Encryption project? *(Volume of eligible data sets, data mapping, volume of eligible network connections, network mapping)*

:question: **PERFORMANCE** - What could be the overhead? *(Performance, Consumption, Project elapse...)*


## PERDA target audience :bulb:
All IBM Z clients (having respectively z/OS and/or Linux on IBM Z) who envision to start a Pervasive Encryption project on their IBM Z or LinuxONE environments are eligible to a PERDA study.

## PERDA benefits and advantages

### Benefits
Starting with on a data collection phase, after a deep analysis of data, the client will know what are steps they still have to make to be ready for Pervasive Encryption. They will get deep insights:
* From the components they will need to configure first
* Intermediate and required stpes to broad the volume of eligible data sets and network connections
* What are the best practices in terms of crypto configuration, secured network protocols and key management on IBM Z

### Advantages
The PERDA study requires a very small client investment in time and effort. Client send data, and the IBM team works from these data.

The team in charge of PERDA has more than 1 year of customer experience spent in Pervasive Encryption projects. More over, Montpellier Client Center team has more than 10 years of zMAX study and PERDA has the similar approach and efficiency (Data collection first, Site client delivery second).

PERDA is based on a technical study. From our client data we can see everything that matter to evaluate client readiness for Pervasive Encryption deployment. Their data reveals the following:
* Hardware/Software readiness
* OS limitations
* Available white space for Pervasive Encryption projects
* Encryption maturity and skills
* How optimized is the crypto environment
* Data set structures, volumes and degree of elibility
* Network architecture, volumes of unsecured network connections
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS data set encryption on selected LPARs
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS coupling facility encryption on selected LPARs

PERDA includes two main livrables:
  * 1day on client site summary presentation
  * 100+ pages report

## PERDA delivery time :calendar:
PERDA starts by contacting the IBM Client Center of Montpelier team.
* Following a formal engament process and once client and IBM team has an agreement the PERDA study process can start.
* Client collects technical data and share it with the IBM team.
* The IBM team checks and validates received data. Count up to 7 days for this step according received volumes.
* The IBM team starts to analyse received data. Count up to 15 days for this step according received volumes.
* The IBM team creates a delivery package made of technical reports, and an exective summary powerpoint presentation.
* The PERDA study is delivered by the IBM Team on client premises during a 1 day technical workshop.
