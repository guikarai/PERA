# What is PERA?
Pervasive Encryption Readiness Assessment (or simply PERA) is an offering proposed by the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. PERA is a study help for client expecting having answer about the following questions:
* **READINESS** - Am I ready to start a Pervasive Encryption project? (Hardware, Software, Skills, Processes...)
* **VOLUMES** - Does my today volume of data justify to jump-in Pervasive Encryption project? (Volume of elligible data sets, data mapping, volume of elligible network connections, network mapping)
* **PERFORMANCE** - What could be the overhead? (Performance, Consumption, Project elapse...)

# PERA advantages
The PERA study requires a very small client investment in time and effort.
Montpellier client center team having more than 10 years of zMAX study, PERA has the similar approach and efficiency.
The team in charge of PERA has more than 1 year of customer experience spent in Pervasive Encryption projects.
PERA is based on technical study from where we see everything:
* Their encryption maturity
* Their data set structures
* Their network architecture and the volume of network connections
* How optimized is their environment

Two main livrables:
  * 1day on-site summary presentation
  * 200+ pages report
