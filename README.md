# Pervasive Encryption Readiness Assessment
A technical assessment from the IBM Client Center, Montpellier. 

## What is PERA?
The vision of Pervasive Encryption is to provide a simple, transparent, and consumable approach to enable extensive encryption of data in-flight and at-rest to substantially reduce the costs associated with protecting data and achieving compliance mandates.



Pervasive Encryption Readiness Assessment (or simply PERA) is an offering proposed by the IBM Client Center of Montpellier. 
There are 3 main questions our client ask about Pervasive Encryption. PERA as a technical study has been designed to help them having answer about the following questions:

:question: **READINESS** - Am I ready to start a Pervasive Encryption project? *(Hardware, Software, Skills, Processes...)*

:question: **VOLUMES** - Does my today volume of data justify to jump-in Pervasive Encryption project? *(Volume of elligible data sets, data mapping, volume of elligible network connections, network mapping)*

:question: **PERFORMANCE** - What could be the overhead? *(Performance, Consumption, Project elapse...)*


## PERA target audience
All IBM Z clients (having respectively z/OS and/or Linux on IBM Z) who envision to enable pervasive encryption on their IBM Z or LinuxONE environments is elligible to a PERA study.

## PERA benefits and advantages

### Benefits
Starting with on a data collection phase, after a deep analyse of data, the client will know what are the steps they still have to take to be ready for pervasive encryption. They will get deep insights:
* from the components they will need to configure
* intermediate and required stpes to broad the volume of elligible data sets and network connections
* what are the best practices in terms of crypto configuration, secured network protocols and key management on IBM Z

### Advantages
The PERA study requires a very small client investment in time and effort. Client send data, and the IBM team works from these data.

The team in charge of PERA has more than 1 year of customer experience spent in Pervasive Encryption projects.More over, Montpellier client center team having more than 10 years of zMAX study and PERA has the similar approach and efficiency (Data collection first, Site client delivery second).

PERA is based on technical study. From our client data we can see everything that matters to evaluate client readiness for Pervasive Encryption. These data reveal the following:
* Hardware/Software readiness
* Available whitespace for Pervasive Encryption projects
* Encryption maturity
* How optimized is the crypto environment
* Data set structures, volumes and degree of ellibility
* Network architecture, volumes of unsecured network connections
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS data set encryption on selected LPARs
* Estimation of Impact of z/OS coupling facility encryption on selected LPARs

PERA includes two main livrables:
  * 1day on client site summary presentation
  * 200+ pages report

## PERA delivery time
PERA start by contacting the IBM Client Center of Montpellier team.

   :telephone_receiver: Following a formal engament process and once client and IBM team has an agreement the PERA study process can start.
   :file_folder: Client collects technical data and share it with the IBM team.
   :ok: The IBM team checks and validates received data. Count up to 7 days for this step according received volumes.
   :bar_chart: The IBM team starts to analyse received data. Count up to 15 days for this step according received volumes.
   :notebook: The IBM team create a delivery package made of technical reports, and an exective summary powerpoint presentation.
   :calendar: The PERA study is delivered by the IBM Team on client premises during a 1 day technical workshop.
